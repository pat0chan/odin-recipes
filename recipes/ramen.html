        <h3>Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat or (occasionally) fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, nori (dried seaweed), menma, and scallions. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu, and the miso ramen of Hokkaido. Mazemen is a ramen dish that is not served in a soup, but rather with a sauce (such as tare).</h3>

                <li>50g ginger root, sliced</li>
                <li>3 gloves garlic, skinned</li>

                <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Noodles</li>
            <ul>
                <li>9 oz fresh angel hair pasta (225g)</li>
                <li>8 cups water (2l)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp baking soda</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Topping</li>
            <ul>
                <li>boiled egg halves</li>
                <li>bean sprouts, blanched briefly</li>
                <li>green onions, cut finely</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub salt on pork and let it sit overnight in the fridge.</li>
            <li>In a pot, put water, ginger root, garlic, green onions and salted pork, and boil at high heat. Skim fat and other floating scums. Then cover, reduce to low heat, and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Let the broth and pork cool completely in pot. Strain and save pork. Slice pork and set aside for a topping.</li>
            <li>Prepare the rest of the toppings now as well (boiled eggs, blanched bean sprouts, cut green onions), before making the soup and noodles. Once the noodles are cooked, you will need to add the soup and toppings right away or the noodles will get soft, so you won't have time to prepare the toppings at the end.</li>
            <li>Boil the broth and add soy sauce, sake, salt and sesame oil. Let it simmer at very low heat until noodles are ready.</li>
            <li>In boiling water in a pot, add baking soda (be careful, it may boil over), then add the fresh angel hair pasta. Cook the pasta for 30 seconds, and strain. Immediately divide noodles into bowls and add soup onto noodles. Top with boiled eggs, bean sprouts, green onions and sliced pork.</li>
        </ol>
